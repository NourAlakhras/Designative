      <button class="accordion">Q: What is Designative?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>
          A: Designative is a platform that connects multimedia specialists, customers,
          and corporations in one place. It allows specialists to share and sell their
          work, while customers and corporations can explore the work of a variety of
          designers or own some works. The goal is to help multimedia specialists get
          great opportunities from giant corporations, and corporations get unique
          services without the need for commitment to the worker.

          specialists and companies lacking the right talent but not wanting to commit
          to a particular worker. Multimedia specialists can share and sell their works
          on the platform, while corporations and customers can browse and purchase
          these works or hire specialists for custom projects. Designative acts as the
          middleman, facilitating communication and transactions between the two
          parties.
